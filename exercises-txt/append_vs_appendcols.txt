	append vs appendcols	


	APPEND
	You have two data sets with the exact set of columns (will work with non same columns sets
	but you will get a mess on your hands)
	[ data set A with columns f1,f2,...fn ] K lines
	[ data set B with columns f1,f2,...fn ] M lines
	K+M lines


	APPENDCOLS
	usually you want to the two data sets to have THE SAME NUMBER OF LINES
	the DONT have to have the same colums or even the same number of columns
	[ data set A with columns f1,f2,...fn ] K lines
	[ data set B with columns g1,g2,...gm ] K lines

	the result will have K lines
	[ f1,f2,... fn, g1, g2,... gm]
	[ f1,f2,... fn, g1, g2,... gm]
	[ f1,f2,... fn, g1, g2,... gm]
	[ f1,f2,... fn, g1, g2,... gm]
