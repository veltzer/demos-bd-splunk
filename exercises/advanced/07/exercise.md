# Pivot

* we will work with the basic query:
    `index="web" action="add"`

* we want to exapnd this query to show the prices of the products being added to the cart.

* the product name exists as `product_name`

* create an additional table that translates `product_name` into `product_price`. Make up prices, they don't matter.

* Now demostrate how you use the `pivot` splunk command to expand the basic query:
    `index="web" action="add"`
to show the prices of the products, and not just their names.
