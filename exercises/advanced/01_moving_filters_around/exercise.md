# Job Inspector and Performance

* import the `access_combined.log` file which is in this folder.

* We want to call the index "web". so first create an index named "web".

* then import the log file into that index.

* create your own query on this index and show some data.

* this is the hard part: create a query which involves sorting and filters and show with the job inspector how you can reduce the work of a query by moving the filtering and sorting around.
