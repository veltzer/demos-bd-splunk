### Add Data Manually
Let's start by downloading the data. You'll upload public data for consumer and visitor insights for neighborhoods from the US Census Bureau's census block group (CBG).

```
A CBG is the most granular level the US Census Bureau reports data on, and it covers ~1,500 households.

SafeGraph derived the popularity of a CBG or distances traveled to a CBG by analyzing a large panel of GPS movement data.

We also combined this GPS data with our dataset of five million building footprints for points of interest in the US (SafeGraph Places) to determine visits to places like stores or restaurants. We used these visit counts to derive consumer insights such as top brands (like, say, McDonald's) visited in a CBG.
