You can create reports via Splunk four ways:

1. From "Search," by saving a search as a report
2. From "Pivot," by saving a pivot as a report
3. By navigating to "Settings > Searches," reports, and alerts, and clicking "New" to add a new report
4. From a dashboard, by converting an inline-search-powered dashboard panel to a report
