	data source | f1 | f2 | f3

	examples of filters:
	where
	dedup
	stats
	....

	imagine we could change the order of filters:

	data source | f1 | f2 | f3
	data source | f2 | f1 | f3
	...

	The question is in what order do we want the filters?

	data source | strongest filter | second strongest filter | ...

	
	data source | filter only women | filter only certain cases of cancer
	data source | filter only certain of cancer | filter women
